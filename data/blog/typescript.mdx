In TypeScript, two types are compatible if their internal structure is compatible. This allows us to implement an interface just by having the shape the interface requires, without an explicit `implements` clause.

There are two syntaxes for building types: [Interfaces and Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?e=83#example/types-vs-interfaces). You should prefer `interface`. Use `type` when you need specific features.

Calling `Date()` in JavaScript returns a string. On the other hand, constructing a `Date` with `new Date()` actually gives us a `Date` object.

It's best not to add annotations when the type system would end up inferring the same type anyway.

## Optional properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are optional. To do this, add a `?` after the property name.

```ts
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
printName({ first: 'Bob' })
printName({ first: 'Alice', last: 'Alison' })
```

In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn't exist, you'll get the value undefined rather than a runtime error. Because of this, when you read from an optional property, you'll have to check for undefined before using it.

```ts
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Error - might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
Object is possibly 'undefined'.
  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    // OK
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  }

  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an `interface` are available in `type`, the key distinction is that a `type` cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an `interface` which is always extendable. If you would like a heuristic, use `interface` until you need to use features from `type`.

## Literal Types

[TypeScript Handbook > Literal Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types)

## `null` and `undefined`

JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`.

### `strictNullChecks` off

With `strictNullChecks` off, values that might be `null` or `undefined` can still be accessed normally, and the values `null` and `undefined` can be assigned to a property of any type.

### `strictNullChecks` on

With [strictNullChecks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) on, when a value is `null` or `undefined`, you will need to test for those values before using methods or properties on that value.

```ts
function doSomething(x: string | null) {
  if (x === null) {
    // do nothing
  } else {
    console.log('Hello, ' + x.toUpperCase())
  }
}
```

TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing `null` and `undefined` from a type without doing any explicit checking. Writing `!` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn't `null` or `undefined`:

```ts
function liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {
  // No error
  console.log(x!.toFixed())
}
```

Just like other type assertions, this doesn't change the runtime behavior of your code, so it's important to only use `!` when you know that the value can't be `null` or `undefined`.
